# Air-quality-index_project
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a number used in weather reports to show how polluted the air is. It tells you how clean or dirty the air around you is and how it can affect your health. A lower AQI means the air is clean, while a higher AQI means the air is polluted and may be harmful to breathe.
